# Careers in Computer Science: Software Developer

## Job Description & Responsibilities

A software developer’s designs and builds software for various purposes to fulfill the client’s demands on their program. 
This job is oriented around the clients, which are commonly companies that request business software. A software developer has the responsibility to code a program that meets the basic requirements the clients asked for. On top of that, they also must constantly make improvements while the software is in development; for example, they have to produce clean code and use more efficient algorithms. 


## Required Skills

There are several skills that are necessary to acquire to be a software developer. First of all, two technical skills you must have been a deep understanding of programming languages and the ability to code in TDD. Without these skills, you will not be able to code any executable programs. It is also recommended to learn multiple programming languages as the programming language you will be using in your future job strongly depends on your working environment. Thus, knowing multiple languages can definitely help as you can accept more varieties of jobs that require knowledges in different languages, without limiting yourself in one specific language.

Other than that, you must also have great analytical and organizational skills as most of the time, you might not receive well-organized requirements from the client. Thus, your analytic skills may help you to analyze the requirements of the software and the best method to code it. Collaboration skills are also needed because as a software developer, it is difficult to develop the entire program all by yourself. Hence you usually work in teams and this is when collaboration skills come important.


## Institution for Standard Education

The software developer pathway requires a degree in computer science.
The University of Waterloo is a university that is famous for its math and computing faculty. They offer computer science program. The computer science course in University of Waterloo is well known for its well-organized co-op program which may come helpful to my future career.

## Entrance Requirements

The entrance prerequisites for computer science course in different universities are slightly different. However, there are some prerequisites in common, such as the Advanced Functions (MHF4U), Calculus & Vectors (MCV4U) and English (ENG4U) credits. Most top universities in Ontario requires a low to mid 90 as an best six 4U credits average score. 


## First Year Courses

For the courses I will be taking on my first year, I will use University of Waterloo’s computer science courses as a reference. 

### First Semester
From September to December, I will take programming designing courses ([CS 135](http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/CS/135)) as well as algebra and calculus based math courses ([MATH 135](http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/MATH/135), [MATH 137](http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/MATH/137)). In addition, I will take a communication skills course, which is a mandatory course and may hopefully make me a better collaborator by improving my communications skills. 

### Second Semester
From January to April, I will take more math courses ([MATH 136](http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/MATH/136), [MATH 138](http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/MATH/138)) as they are mandatory. I will also take computer science courses ([CS 136](http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/CS/136), [CS 136L](https://ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/2223/COURSE/course-CS.html#CS136L)) that are more related to software development. 


## Time Taken for Course Completion

Just like most university courses, computer sciences degree regularly takes four years to complete. Alternatively, if you enrolled in the co-op program, it will take another year to complete because during year 2 and year 3, you will be out for working on co-op jobs. for some of the academic terms. Hence, it takes a total of five years if you are into co-op.

## Experimental Learning

### Co-op Program
Other than the standard acadamic pathway, work experience in the related field is also critical when it comes to getting a job. Hence, while attending regular standard learning, computer science students can also take a different approach. Co-op programs are offered in many universities. If a student enroll in a Co-op program, they take one more year to complete their degree as some of your academic terms will be occupied as co-op terms; and you will be working in those terms instead of studying on your degree.

On the other hand, Co-op program provides job opportunities which are precious experiences that benefits you in future job interviews; as you will have a more "outstanding" profile than regular students and are given an opportunity to learn briefly about the working environment out there. 

### Self-Starter Projects
Self-starter projects can also come handy when it comes to getting jobs. These individual projects are created all by yourself and are real products that can be showcased to your interviewers. It, again, may make your job opportunities more "outstanding" show your motivation towards coding. They also act as great examples and proofs of your actual programming skills. Nevertheless, they are also an ideal practice of coding projects, which allows students to jump out from the theories and acquire a deeper understanding of how to create an actual functioning, user-friendly program.


## Real Job Careers and Salary Ranges

### Entry level
First of all, every developer starts as a junior software developer, the approximate salary of an entry level software developer in The Great Toronto Area lies at around *$50-60k/year*. Their job descriptions are most likely to be simple work, such as: 
1. Monitoring technical performance 
2. fixing minor bugs
3. maintaining the code 
4. gathering user feedbacks, etc.

### Average level
After a few years of working in the industry, a developer experiences allows them to be participate in more important parts of software development, as well as enjoying higher rewards. For an average software developer's, the salary is at around *$80-90k/year*. An average software developer's job is to: 
1. work with other members in the development teams and the customers to ideate software solutions
2. Design both client-side and server-side architecture
3. build the front-end of applications 
4. create security, data protection settings, etc.

### Senior level 
On par with their high skill levels, a senior software developer has an average salary of *$100-110k/year*. With the higher wages also come with higher responsibilities. Senior developers are more likely to be in charge for the whole project, which they are have the responsibility to: 
1. manage the project from end-to-end 
2. actively participating in designing, building and delivering the products at the same time. 
3. lead and mentor their development teams, etc.
