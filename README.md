# Careers in Computer Science
---
## 1. The Basics

### Job Description & Responsibilities

A software developer’s designs and builds software for various purposes to fulfill the client’s demands on their program. 
This job is oriented around the clients, which are commonly companies that request business software. A software developer has the responsibility to code a program that meets the basic requirements the clients asked for. On top of that, they also must constantly make improvements while the software is in development; for example, they have to produce clean code and use more efficient algorithms. 

### Required Skills & Salary Range

There are several skills that are necessary to acquire to be a software developer. First of all, two technical skills you must have been a deep understanding of programming languages and the ability to code in TDD. Without these skills, you will not be able to code any executable programs. 

Other than that, you must also have great analytical and organizational skills as most of the time, you might not receive well-organized requirements from the client. Thus, your analytic skills may help you to analyze the requirements of the software and the best method to code it. Collaboration skills are also needed because as a software developer, it is difficult to develop the entire program all by yourself. Hence you usually work in teams and this is when collaboration skills come important.

As for the wage, the average salary of a software developer in The Great Toronto Area lies at around *$80 000/year*.

## 2. Standard Education

### Educational institution
The software developer pathway requires a degree in computer science.
The University of Waterloo is a university that is famous for its math and computing faculty. They offer computer science program. The computer science course in University of Waterloo is well known for its well-organized co-op program which may come helpful to my future career.

### Entrance Requirements
The entrance prerequisites for computer science course in different universities are slightly different. However, there are some prerequisites in common, such as the Advanced Functions (MHF4U), Calculus & Vectors (MCV4U) and English (ENG4U) credits. Most top universities in Ontario requires a low to mid 90 as an best six 4U credits average score. 

### First Year Courses
For the courses I will be taking on my first year, I will use University of Waterloo’s computer science courses as a reference. On the first semester of my first year, I will take programming designing courses([CS 135](http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/CS/135)) as well as algebra and calculus based math courses([MATH 135](http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/MATH/135), [MATH 137](http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/MATH/137)). In addition, I will take a communication skills course, which is a mandatory course and may hopefully make me a better collaborator by improving my communications skills. On the second semester, I will take more math courses([MATH 136](http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/MATH/136), [MATH 138](http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/MATH/138)) as they are mandatory. I will also take computer science courses([CS 136](http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/courses/CS/136), [CS 136L](https://ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/2223/COURSE/course-CS.html#CS136L) that are more related to software development. 

### Length of time for completion
Just like most university courses, computer sciences degree regularly takes four years to complete. Alternatively, if you enrolled in the co-op program, it may take another year to complete because from year 2; for some of your academic terms, you will be out for working on co-op jobs. In fact, your entire year 4 will be a “co-op year” that you will have a full year long job internship. Then you will come back to the campus and finish your studies on the fifth year.
